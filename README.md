# Agent-With-Custom-MCP-Server
This project demonstrates building a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) server from scratch and integrating it seamlessly with a Gradio-based chat application. It extends the previous work of connecting existing MCP servers by providing full control over server behavior and enabling deeper customization for AI agent workflows.
